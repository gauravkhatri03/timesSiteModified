Tasks Completed- 
1. Made the blog page
    1.1 It has 2 components which help make the overall BlogPage-
        1.1.1 src->compnents->BlogPageComponents->BlogCard.jsx
        1.1.2 src->compnents->BlogPageCompnents->BlogHeader.jsx
    1.2 As of now, I have made 2 BlogPage designs which I couldn't decide which one to use so please check them both out
        1.2.1 src->views->BlogPage->BlogPage.jsx
        1.2.2 src->views->BlogPage->BlogPage2.jsx
    1.3 The routes for the 2 blog pages are as follows
        1.3.1 /blog
        1.3.2 /blog2
2. Made the NavBar
    2.1 src>-components->NavBars->ExamplesNavbar.jsx (please note that IndexNavbar.jsx is not the NavBar to be used)
3. Made a sample footer and is not the finalised footer. Just made it to go with DTU Times theme and think it of as just a prop footer
4. Made a new folder named services which contains a js file for fetching blog data from api (currently it doesn't do anything and is for future reference)
